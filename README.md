## lsp: list files in a mildly human-frendlier manner
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dborzov/lsp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dborzov/lsp)

`lsp` lists files, like [`ls`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls) command,
but it does not attempt to meet
that archaic POSIX specification, so instead of this:
```
(bash)$ ls -l

total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 peterborzov  staff  1079  9 Aug 00:22 LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 peterborzov  staff    60  9 Aug 00:22 README.md
```

you get this:

## Features
#### File Groups
Files grouped by type (with `-l` key or in modes when file type not shown). `lsp` distinguishes binary, text and executable files, symlinks and is aware of weird types like devices and unix socket thingy:

#### Modification time in human-friendly format
`-t` key for when you are interested in modification time. It turns to the mode that makes most sense to me when I want to look up modtimes, sorted within file groups from recent to latest:

Sometimes relative times are  not very readible as well (like when you are interested in a specific date), use two flags `-sl` to show the full UTC timestamp in properties.
#### Size in human-friendly format
`-s` key, similarly to modtime key, shows file sizes and sorts within file groups from largest to smallest:

#### Async Timeout
The file information is collected asynchronously, BFS-like, with a separate thread for each file and a timeout threshold.

That means that the execution is not going to freeze because of some low-response device driver (like external hard drive or optical drive) or collecting info about a huge directory.

#### Align by left
I have been playing with aligning files and descriptions by center, and I like that you can see files with the same extension right away, but there are deifinitely cases when it gets weird.
For now, there is `-p` key to render the file table in the left-aligned columns:

## Todo before v1.0
- [ ] Rewrite outline formatting: with the current design too much space is wasted, long filenames break things
- [x] Mark executable files as such
- Think about how to represent file rights and ownership
- Approach hidden and generated files as outlined in [issue#3](https://github.com/dborzov/lsp/issues/3)
- Better test coverage
- Expand in this README on philosophy of the project (tool in the unix way, minimize surprises, nothing's to be configurable)
- Think of TODO list points

## Installation

`lsp` is written in the `go` programming language.
It can be installed using `go get`.

```
 $ go get github.com/dborzov/lsp
```

Then make sure that your `$PATH` includes the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
To do that, you can put this line your `~/.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Once it becomes more functional, `lsp` will be distributed in native binaries
(without dependencies) for all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows).
